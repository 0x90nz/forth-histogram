# forth-histogram
Small Forth program to count letters from input

If you've got `gforth` installed you can run it with `gforth histogram.fth`.
It'll wait until EOF and once this is encountered, print out the results.

For example, if you wanted to get the histogram of the program itself, you
could do `gforth histogram.fth < histogram.fth`.
